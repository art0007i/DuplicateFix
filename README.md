# DuplicateFix

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that makes it so duplicated items maintain references between each other. Also fixes references breaking when transferring objects between worlds.

this fixes github issue [#984](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/984)

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [DuplicateFix.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/DuplicateFix/releases/latest/download/DuplicateFix.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
